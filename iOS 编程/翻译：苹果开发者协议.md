You agree not to represent otherwise.  You also certify that you are at least thirteen years of age and you represent that you are legally permitted to register as an Apple Developer.  This Agreement is void where prohibited by law and the right to register as an Apple Developer is not granted in such jurisdictions.  Unless otherwise agreed or permitted by Apple in writing, you cannot share or transfer any benefits you receive from Apple in connection with being an Apple Developer.  The Apple ID and password you use to log into your Apple Developer account cannot be shared in any way or with anyone.  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Apple ID and password and for any activity in connection with your account.

	**与苹果的关系; Apple ID和密码。** 您理解并同意，通过向Apple注册成为Apple开发者（“**Apple开发人员**”），您与Apple之间不会建立任何法律合作关系或代理关系。 您同意不以其他方式表示。 您还证明您至少十三岁，并且您代表您已合法获准注册为Apple开发人员。 本协议在法律禁止的情况下无效，并且在这些司法管辖区不授予注册为Apple开发人员的权利。 除非Apple以书面形式另有约定或允许，否则您不能分享或转让您从Apple成为Apple开发人员时收到的任何好处。 您用于登录Apple Developer帐户的Apple ID和密码不能以任何方式或与任何人共享。 您有责任保持您的Apple ID和密码以及与您的帐户相关的任何活动的机密性。

2. **Developer Benefits.**  As an Apple Developer, you may have the opportunity to attend certain Apple developer conferences, technical talks, and other events (including online or electronic broadcasts of such events) (“**Apple Events**”).  In addition, Apple may offer to provide you with certain services (“**Services**”), as described more fully herein and on the Apple Developer web pages (“**Site**”), solely for your own use in connection with your participation as an Apple Developer.  Services may include, but not be limited to, any services Apple offers at Apple Events or on the Site as well as the offering of any content or materials displayed on the Site (“**Content**”).  Apple may change, suspend or discontinue providing the Services, Site and Content to you at any time, and may impose limits on certain features and materials offered or restrict your access to parts or all of such materials without notice or liability.

	**开发者优势**。作为Apple开发者，您可以有机会参加某些Apple开发人员会议，技术会谈和其他活动（包括此类活动的在线或电子广播）（“Apple活动”）。 此外，苹果可能会向您提供某些服务（“服务”），如本文和Apple开发人员网页（“网站”）中所述，仅供您自己使用，作为您作为Apple开发人员的参与 。 服务可能包括但不限于Apple在Apple活动或网站上提供的任何服务，以及网站上显示的任何内容或材料（“内容”）的提供。 Apple可能随时更改，暂停或停止向您提供服务，网站和内容，并且可能对所提供的某些功能和材料施加限制，或限制您访问部分或所有此类材料，而无需通知或承担任何责任。

3. **Restrictions**.  You agree not to exploit the Site, or any Services, Apple Events or Content provided to you by Apple as an Apple Developer, in any unauthorized way, including but not limited to, by trespass, burdening network capacity or using the Services, Site or Content other than for authorized purposes.  Copyright and other intellectual property laws protect the Site and Content provided to you, and you agree to abide by and maintain all notices, license information, and restrictions contained therein.  Unless expressly permitted herein or otherwise permitted in a separate agreement with Apple, you may not modify, publish, network, rent, lease, loan, transmit, sell, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce, create derivative works based on, redistribute, perform, display, or in any way exploit any of the Site, Content or Services.  You may not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of any software or security components of the Services, Site, or Content (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by any licensing terms accompanying the foregoing).  Use of the Site, Content or Services to violate, tamper with, or circumvent the security of any computer network, software, passwords, encryption codes, technological protection measures, or to otherwise engage in any kind of illegal activity, or to enable others to do so, is expressly prohibited.  Apple retains ownership of all its rights in the Site, Content, Apple Events and Services, and except as expressly set forth herein, no other rights or licenses are granted or to be implied under any Apple intellectual property.

4. **Confidentiality**.  Except as otherwise set forth herein, you agree that any Apple pre-release software, services, and/or hardware (including related documentation and materials) provided to you as an Apple Developer (“**Pre-Release Materials**”) and any information disclosed by Apple to you in connection with Apple Events will be considered and referred to as “**Apple Confidential Information**”. 

 	**保密**。 除非另有规定，否则您同意，作为Apple开发者（“**预发布材料**”）提供给您的任何Apple预发布软件，服务和/或硬件（包括相关文档和材料） Apple向您披露的任何与Apple事件相关的信息将被视为“** Apple机密信息**”。
 	
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, Apple Confidential Information will not include: (a) information that is generally and legitimately available to the public through no fault or breach of yours; (b) information that is generally made available to the public by Apple; (c) information that is independently developed by you without the use of any Apple Confidential Information; (d) information that was rightfully obtained from a third party who had the right to transfer or disclose it to you without limitation; or (e) any third party software and/or documentation provided to you by Apple and accompanied by licensing terms that do not impose confidentiality obligations on the use or disclosure of such software and/or documentation.  Further, Apple agrees that you will not be bound by the foregoing confidentiality terms with regard to technical information about Apple pre-release software, services and/or hardware disclosed by Apple at WWDC (Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference), except that you may not post screen shots of, write public reviews of, or redistribute any such materials.

 	尽管有上述规定，Apple机密信息将不包括：（a）普遍向公众投放的合法且无错误的或与您相违反的信息; （b）苹果一般向公众提供的信息; （c）您在未使用任何Apple保密信息的情况下独立开发的信息; （d）从有权无限制转让或披露给您的第三方正当获得的信息;（e）苹果向您提供的任何第三方软件和/或文档，并附有许可条款，不对使用或披露此类软件和/或文档施加保密义务。此外，苹果同意，您不受上述保密条款的约束关于苹果公布的苹果预发布软件，服务和/或硬件的技术信息在WWDC（苹果的全球开发人员会议），除了您不能发布屏幕截图，撰写公众评论或重新分发任何此类材料。
 	
5. **Nondisclosure and Nonuse of Apple Confidential Information.** Unless otherwise expressly agreed or permitted in writing by Apple, you agree not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Apple Confidential Information to anyone other than to other Apple Developers who are employees and contractors working for the same entity as you and then only to the extent that Apple does not otherwise prohibit such disclosure.  Except for your authorized purposes as an Apple Developer or as otherwise expressly agreed or permitted by Apple in writing, you agree not to use Apple Confidential Information in any way, including, without limitation, for your own or any third party’s benefit without the prior written approval of an authorized representative of Apple in each instance.  You further agree to take reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of Apple Confidential Information.  You acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or use of Apple Confidential Information could cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Apple that may be difficult to ascertain.  Accordingly, you agree that Apple will have the right to seek immediate injunctive relief to enforce your obligations under this Agreement in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have.  If you are required by law, regulation or pursuant to the valid binding order of a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose Apple Confidential Information, you may make such disclosure, but only if you have notified Apple before making such disclosure and have used commercially reasonable efforts to limit the disclosure and to seek confidential, protective treatment of such information.  A disclosure pursuant to the previous sentence will not relieve you of your obligations to hold such information as Apple Confidential Information.

 	**不披露和不使用Apple机密信息**除非Apple另有明确约定或书面允许，否则您同意不向任何人士披露，发布或传播任何Apple保密信息，而不是向属于员工和承包商的其他Apple开发人员与您在同一实体工作，然后只在苹果没有另外禁止此类披露的范围内。除了您作为Apple开发人员的授权用途或Apple以书面形式明确同意或允许的，您同意不以任何方式使用Apple Confidential信息，包括但不限于您自己或任何第三方的利益，批准苹果授权代表。您还同意采取合理的预防措施，防止任何未经授权的使用，披露，出版或传播Apple机密信息。您承认未经授权披露或使用Apple机密信息可能会对Apple造成无法弥补的伤害和重大损害，这可能很难确定。因此，您同意苹果有权要求立即禁止救济，以执行您在本协议下的义务，以及任何其他权利和补救措施。如果法律，法规或根据有管辖权法院有效的约束性命令要求披露Apple机密信息，您可以进行此类披露，但前提是您在做出此类披露之前已通知Apple，并且已在商业上合理的努力限制披露和寻求这些信息的保密，保护性处理。根据前一句的披露不会免除您有义务保存此类信息（如Apple机密信息）。

6. **Confidential Pre-Release Materials License and Restrictions.**  If Apple provides you with Pre-Release Materials, then subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple hereby grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, right and license to use the Pre-Release Materials only for the limited purposes set forth in this Section 6; provided however that if such Pre-Release Materials are subject to a separate license agreement, you agree that the license agreement accompanying such materials in addition to Sections 4 and 5 of this Agreement shall also govern your use of the Pre-Release Materials.  You further agree that in the event of any inconsistency between Section 4 and 5 of this Agreement and the confidentiality restrictions in the license agreement, the license agreement shall govern.  You agree not to use the Pre-Release Materials for any purpose other than testing and/or development by you of a product designed to operate in combination with the same operating system for which the Pre-Release Materials are designed.  This Agreement does not grant you any right or license to incorporate or make use of any Apple intellectual property (including for example and without limitation, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and industrial designs) in any product.  Except as expressly set forth herein, no other rights or licenses are granted or to be implied under any Apple intellectual property.  You agree not to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the Pre-Release Materials to a human-perceivable form, and you will not modify, network, rent, lease, transmit, sell, or loan the Pre-Release Materials in whole or in part.

 	**预发布机密材料许可和限制**如果Apple提供了预发布材料，则在遵守本协议条款和条件的前提下，Apple特此授予您非独占，不可转让的权利和许可，使用预发布材料仅用于本第6节中规定的有限目的;但如果此类预发布材料受单独的许可协议约束，则您同意除本协议第4和第5节之外附带此类材料的许可协议也适用于您对预发布材料的使用。您还同意，如果本协议第4条和第5条之间存在任何不一致之处，以及许可协议中的保密限制，则以许可协议为准。您同意不将预发布材料用于除了测试和/或开发由设计与预发布材料设计的相同操作系统组合操作的产品之外的任何目的。本协议不授予您在任何产品中包含或使用任何Apple知识产权（包括但不限于商业秘密，专利，版权，商标和工业品外观设计）的任何权利或许可。除非在此明确规定，否则任何其他权利或许可均不得被授予或暗示在任何苹果知识产权下。您同意不反编译，反向工程，拆卸或以其他方式将预发布材料减少为人类可感知形式，并且您不得修改，广播，出租，租赁，传输，销售或借用预发布材料全部或部分。

Your rights under this license to use and access the Content will terminate automatically without notice from Apple if you fail to comply with any of these provisions.
